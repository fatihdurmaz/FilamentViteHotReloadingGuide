# Filament - Vite Hot Reloading

For developers, time and efficiency are of great importance. Therefore, understanding how to get started with the concept of hot reloading using powerful tools like Vite.js when developing backends with Laravel and Filament can speed up development processes and make them smoother. Vite is a fast fronted build tool that significantly improves the development experience. When combined with Laravel, it allows the browser to automatically reflect these changes in the interface as soon as code changes are made.

In this guide, I will explain how hot reloading can be used in web applications, combining the powerful server-side capabilities provided by Laravel, the form, table, admin panel and many other components of the Filament package, and the potential of Vite.js to create a fast, modern structure. .

## 1. Laravel Vite Plugin

### a. vite.config.js Hot Reloading Integration (Optional) 

This plugin refreshes the page every time a change is made. It does not refresh the modified component or any element on the page.


        import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
        import laravel, { refreshPaths } from 'laravel-vite-plugin'
        
        export default defineConfig({
            plugins: [
                laravel({
                    input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
                    refresh: [
                        ...refreshPaths,
                        'app/Http/Livewire/**', // Custom Livewire components
                        'app/Filament/**', // Filament Resources
                    ],
                }),
            ],
        });
        
### b. Vite Livewire Plugin (Optional)

#### i.[vite-livewire-plugin](https://github.com/defstudio/vite-livewire-plugin) installing the plugin and calling it in the app.js file (Recommented)
        
*This plugin refreshes the component or any element on the page every time a change is made. There is no need to refresh the entire page.*

           npm install --save-dev @defstudio/vite-livewire-plugin

           // resources/js/app.js
           import './bootstrap';
           // eklentiyi Ã§aÄŸÄ±rÄ±yoruz aÅŸaÄŸÄ±daki satÄ±lar ile
           import { livewire_hot_reload } from 'virtual:livewire-hot-reload'
           livewire_hot_reload();
        
#### ii. vite.config.js Hot Reloading Integration
        
        import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
        import laravel, { refreshPaths } from 'laravel-vite-plugin';
        import livewire from '@defstudio/vite-livewire-plugin'; // import plugin
        
        export default defineConfig({
            plugins: [
                laravel({
                    input: [
                        'resources/css/app.css',
                        'resources/js/app.js',
                    ],
                    refresh: false,
                }),
        
                livewire({
                    refresh: [
                        ...refreshPaths, // Tracking changes wherever app.js is called
                        'app/Http/Livewire/**', // To monitor LiveWire components (if applicable)
                        'app/Custom/Path/**', // You can show the path to the files you want the vite tool to follow.
                    ]
                }),
            ],
        })
        
## 2. Filament Integration

In order for the changes to be followed by Vite, the app.js file must be added to the Filament panel. We can do it in 2 ways.
   
### a. AppServiceProvider â†’ register() function
            
            use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
            use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;
            
            public function register()
            {
                FilamentView::registerRenderHook('panels::body.end', fn(): string => Blade::render("@vite('resources/js/app.js')"));
            }
            
### b. AdminPanelProvider â†’ renderHook() function
            
            <?php
            
            namespace App\Providers\Filament;
            ...
            ...
            use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;
            
            class AdminPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
            {
                public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
                {
                    return $panel
                        ->default()
                        ->id('admin')
                        ->login()
                        ->colors([
                            'primary' => Color::Amber,
                        ])
                        ...
                        ...
                        ->collapsibleNavigationGroups(false)
                        ->renderHook('panels::body.end', fn (): string => Blade::render("@vite('resources/js/app.js')"))
            						...
            						...
            						...
                }
            }

> After the above steps are completed, we will see that the hot reloading feature has been activated by running the Vite tool and Laravel artisan server.

        npm run dev // vite server run
        php artisan serve // Laravel artisan server run

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ If you do not encounter any problems but hot reloading is not working, you can optimize the Laravel application and solve the problem by running the 'php artisan optimize' command.
